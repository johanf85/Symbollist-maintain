# introduction
A lot of thesis documents contain a lot of mathematical equations. Therefore, in most cases, a symbol list is added to the document and underneath equations parameter definitions are added.
This projects contains a LaTeX solution for creating a symbol list using the 'glossaries' package, together with the 'glossaries-extra' package. Next to this, code is provided for showing parameter definitions under a first declaration of the equation in the document.

The goal of this project is defining symbol definitions and units only once and create symbol list and parameter definitions automatically based on this. To help with this, an Excel file is created. 

Instructions:
Define units 




To do for git project:\
Excel copies content of code with too many spaces and with quotesigns, try to find a solution

Put the symbols in alphabetical order in Latin/Greek combined
